      <p id="title">Binary</p>
      <p id="left">Binary, or Base 2, is a number system that is made up entirely of bits (On/Off). Binary is useful because it can be represented by a 1 or a 0, allowing a single wire to transfer data. When wires are used together, the amount of data they can transport in binary increases exponentially.</p>
      <p id="right">Examples:</p>
      <br>
      <ul id="listr">
      <li>First 16 binary digits: 0000=0, 0001=1, 0010=2, 0011=3, 0100=4, 0101=5, 0110=6, 0111=7, 1000=8, 1001=9, 1010=10, 1011=11, 1100=12, 1101=13, 1110=14, 1111=15. The first 16 numbers of the Binary Sequince. They are made up of 4 digits, and therefore known as 4 bit.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Binary Place Value: Binary has it's own place value system, where the next bit is worth 2x the last bit. For example: 2 bits can show 4 digits (00, 01, 10, 11), whilst 3 bits can show 8 digits (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111). And 4 bits 16 digits, 5 bits 32, and so on. This can also be useful for determining the value of binary numbers- just add the place value of all the positive bits together! For example, take 1101. 0001=1, 0000=0, 0100=4, 1000=8. 1+4+8=13.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Patterns in Binary: Binary numbers arent just random- there is a repeating pattern. For example, if you were to list an infinite number of binary digits in order, you would notice that the first bit alternates on/off for every bit incremented. The second bit turns on and off every two digits, the third one every four, the fourth one every 8. </p>
